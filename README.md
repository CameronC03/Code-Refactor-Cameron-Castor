I changed this webpage to make it function better, I changed the links to make them function properly and cleaned up the css file and added tags in the html file.
I solved the links on the page not going to the right place on the webpage, Also i condensed the css file to make it look more organized.
The reason i wanted to do this project was to practice and get better at coding. 
I learned the littlest errors could mess up the whole page.
